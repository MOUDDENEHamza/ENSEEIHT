Installation Instructions
*************************

Requirements
============

* Ocaml (>= 3.11)
* Apron : Debian package libapron-ocaml-dev: optional,
          only used for polyhedron and octagons relational domains.
* Zarith library

We recommend using opam to install ocaml and dependencies
https://opam.ocaml.org/

Compilation
===========

* Modify file src/myocamlbuild.ml if you intend to use Apron library for
  relational domains (not mandatory at all).
* Set your abstract domain at the beginning of src/analyze.ml
  (or leave it unchanged to use the default domain).
* Cd to the src subdirectory:

  > cd src

* Type make:

  > make

Installing Emacs Mode
=====================

If you intend to use Emacs for editing TINY programs, you are advised
to install the provided Emacs mode.

* Add the following at the beginning of you ~/.emacs file:

(setq load-path (cons "/directory/in/which/you/put/the/file/tiny.el" load-path))
(autoload 'tiny-mode "tiny" "Major mode for editing TINY code" t)
;; comment this if you don't want to automatically load TINY mode with each TINY file 
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append
       '(("\\.tiny" . tiny-mode))
       auto-mode-alist))

Of course, you'll have to adapt the path to the directory (and not the file)
in which you put the file tiny.el (typically the same directory as this
INSTALL file you are just reading).

Generating Ocamldoc Documentation
=================================

If you intend to modify or just browse the code of TINY, you can be interested
in its documentation. This can be generated by 'make doc' in the src directory.
