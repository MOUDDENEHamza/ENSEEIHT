</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This chapter explains how to quickly install, run, and use a
    HyperSQL Listener (aka Server) on UNIX.</p>
<p>Note that, unlike a traditional database server, there are many
    use cases where it makes sense to run HyperSQL without any listener. This
    type of setup is called <em class="glossterm">in-process</em>, and is not
    covered here, since there is no UNIX-specific setup in that
    case.</p>
<p>I intend to cover what I think is the most common UNIX setup: To
    run a multi-user, externally-accessible catalog with permanent data
    persistence. (By the latter I mean that data is stored to disk so that the
    catalog data will persist across process shutdowns and startups). I also
    cover how to run the Listener as a system daemon.</p>
<p>When I give sample shell commands below, I use commands which
    will work in Bourne-compatible shells, including Bash and Korn. Users who
    insist on using the inferior C-shells will need to convert.</p>

<p>Go to <a class="link" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb" target="_top">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb</a> and click on
    the "files" link. You want the current version. I can't be more specific
    because SourceForge/Geeknet are likely to continue changing their
    interface. See if there's a distribution for the current HSQLDB version in
    the format that you want.</p>
<p>If you want a binary package and we either don't provide it, or
    you prefer somebody else's build, you should still find out the current
    version of HyperSQL available at SourceForge. It's very likely that you
    can find a binary package for your UNIX variant with your OS distributor,
    <a class="link" href="http://www.jpackage.org/" target="_top">http://www.jpackage.org/</a>, <a class="link" href="http://sunfreeware.com/" target="_top">http://sunfreeware.com/</a>, etc. Nowadays, most UNIXes
    have software package management systems which check Internet
    repositories. Just search the repositories for "hsqldb" and "hypersql".
    The challenge is to find an <span class="emphasis"><em>up-to-date</em></span> package. You
    will get better features and support if you work with the current stable
    release of HyperSQL. (In particular, HyperSQL version 2.0.0 added tons of
    new features). Pay attention to what JVM versions your binary package
    supports. Our builds (version 2.0 and later) document the Java version it
    was built with in the file <code class="filename">doc/index.html</code>, but you
    can't depend on this if somebody else assembled your distribution. Java
    jar files are generally compatible with the same or greater major
    versions. For example,if your <code class="filename">hsqldb.jar</code> was built
    with Java 1.3.6-11, then it is compatible with Java versions 1.3.* and
    greater.</p>

<p>If the description of your distribution says that the
    <code class="filename">hsqldb.jar</code> file will work for your Java version, then
    you are finished with installation. Otherwise you need to build a new
    <code class="filename">hsqldb.jar</code> file.</p>
<p>If you followed the instructions above and you still don't know
    what Java version your <code class="filename">hsqldb.jar</code> supports, then try
    reading documentation files like <code class="filename">readme.txt</code>,
    <code class="filename">README.TXT</code>, <code class="filename">INSTALL.txt</code> etc. (As
    I said above, our newer distributions always document the Java version for
    the build, in the file <code class="filename">doc/index.html</code>). If that still
    doesn't help, then you can just try your <code class="filename">hsqldb.jar</code>
    and see if it works, or build your own.</p>
<p>To use the supplied <code class="filename">hsqldb.jar</code>, just skip to
    the <a class="link" href="unix-chapt.html#uxc_cat_setup" title="Setting up a HyperSQL Persistent Database Catalog and a HyperSQL Network Listener"> next section of this

<p> The location is entirely dependent upon your

        <code class="filename">/usr/java/something</code>. Sun's System V package
        distributions of Java (including those that come with Solaris)
        normally install to <code class="filename">/usr/something</code>, with a
        sym-link from <code class="filename">/usr/java</code> to the default version

        <code class="filename">/usr/java</code>).</p>

<p>Select a UNIX user to run the database process (JVM) as. If
        this database is for the use of multiple users, or is a production
        system (or to emulate a production system), you should dedicate a UNIX
        user for this purpose. In my examples, I use the user name

        the <code class="varname">HSQLDB_OWNER</code>, since that user will own the
        database catalog files and the JVM processes.</p>
<p>If the account doesn't exist, then create it. On all system-5

        something like </p>

        <code class="filename">server.properties</code>. (As a final reminder,

<pre class="programlisting"># Hsqldb Server cfg file.
# See the HyperSQL Network Listeners chapter of the HyperSQL User Guide.

# Each server.database.X setting defines a database "catalog".
# I.e., an independent set of data.
# Each server.database.X setting corresponds exactly to the jdbc:hsqldb:*
# JDBC URL you would use if you wanted to get a direct (In-Process)
# Connection to the catalog instead of "serving" it.

server.database.0=file:db0/db0
# I suggest that, for every file: catalog you define, you add the
# connection property "ifexists=true" after the database instance
# is created (which happens simply by starting the Server one time).
# Just append ";ifexists=true" to the file: URL, like so:
# server.database.0=file:db0/db0;ifexists=true

# server.dbname.0 defaults to "" (i.e. server.dbname.n for n==0), but
# the catalog definition n will be entirely ignored for n &gt; 0 if you do not
# set server.dbname.n.  I.e. dbname setting is required for n &gt; 0, though it
# may be set to blank (e.g. "server.dbname.3=")
</pre>
<p>Since the value of the first database
        (<span class="property">server.database.0</span>) begins with
        <em class="glossterm">file:</em>, the catalog will be persisted to a set
        of files in the specified directory with names beginning with the
        specified name. Set the path to whatever you want (relative paths will
        be relative to the directory containing the properties file). You can
        read about how to specify other catalogs of various types, and how to
        make settings for the listen port and many other things in other
        chapters of this guide.</p>

<li class="step" title="Step 3">
<p>Set and export the environmental variable

<p>We will be using the "localhost-sa" sample urlid definition from
    the config file. The JDBC URL for this urlid is
    <code class="literal">jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost</code>. That is the URL for the

<p>Note that with SQL-conformant databases like HyperSQL 2.0, user
    names and passwords are case sensitive. If you don't quote the name, it
    will be interpreted as upper-case, like any named SQL object. (Only for
    backwards compatibility, we do make an exception for the special user name
    SA, but you should always use upper-case "SA" nevertheless).</p>
<p>When you're finished playing, exit with the command
    <code class="literal">\q</code>.</p>
<p>If you changed the SA password, then you need to update the
    password in the <code class="filename">sqltool.rc</code> file
    accordingly.</p>
<p>You can, of course, also access the database with any JDBC client
    program. You will need to modify your classpath to include
    <code class="filename">hsqldb.jar</code> as well as your client class(es). You can
    also use the other HSQLDB client programs, such as
    <code class="classname">org.hsqldb.util.DatabasManagerSwing</code>, a graphical
    client with a similar purpose to <code class="classname">SqlTool</code>.</p>
<p>You can use any normal UNIX account to run the JDBC clients,

<p>Connect to the database as SA (or any other Administrative user)
    and run <code class="literal"><a class="literal" href="accesscontrol-chapt.html#create_user-sql">CREATE USER</a></code> to
    create new accounts for your catalog. HSQLDB accounts are
    database-catalog-specific, not
    <code class="classname">Listener</code>-specific.</p>
<p>In SQL-compliant databases, all database objects are created in a
    <span class="emphasis"><em>schema</em></span>. If you don't specify a schema, then the new
    object will be created in the default schema. To create a database object,
    your account (the account that you connected with) must have the role
    <code class="literal">DBA</code>, or your account must have authorization for the
    target schema (see the CREATE SCHEMA command about this last). When you
    first create a HyperSQL catalog, it has only one database user-- SA, a DBA
    account, with an empty string password. You should set a password (as
    described above). You can create as many additional users as you wish. To
    make a user a DBA, you can use the "ADMIN" option to the <code class="literal"><a class="literal" href="accesscontrol-chapt.html#create_user-sql">CREATE USER</a></code> command, command, or
    GRANT the DBA Role to the account after creating it.</p>
<p>Once an object is created, the object creator and users with the
    DBA role will have all privileges to work with that object. Other users
    will have only the rights which the pseudo-user PUBLIC has. To give
    specific users more permissions, even rights to read objects, you can
    GRANT permissions for specific objects, grant Roles (which encompass a set
    of permissions), or grant the DBA Role itself.</p>
<p>Since only people with a database account may do anything at all
    with the database, it is often useful to permit other database users to
    view the data in your tables. To optimize performance, reduce contention,
    and minimize administration, it is often best to grant SELECT to PUBLIC on
    table-like objects that need to be accessed by multiple database users,
    with the significant exception of any data which you want to keep secret.
    (Similarly with EXECUTE priv for routines and USAGE priv for other object
    types). Note that this is not at all equivalent to giving the world or the
    Internet read access to your tables-- you are giving read access to people
    that have been given accounts for the target database catalog.</p>

<p>You can, of course, run HSQLDB through inittab on System V
    UNIXes, but usually an init script is more convenient and manageable. This
    section explains how to set up and use our UNIX init script. Our init
    script is only for use by root. (That is not to say that the
    <span class="emphasis"><em>Listener</em></span> will run as root-- it usually should
    not).</p>
<p>The main purpose of the init script is to start up a Listener for
    the database catalogs specified in your
    <code class="filename">server.properties</code> file; and to gracefully shut down
    these same catalogs. For each catalog defined by a
    <code class="varname">server.database.X</code> setting in your .properties file, you
    must define an administrative "urlid" in your
    <code class="filename">sqltool.rc</code> (these are used to access the catalogs for
    validation and shutdown purposes). Finally, you list the urlid names in
    your init script config file. If, due to firewall issues, you want to run
    a WebServer instead of a Server, then make sure you have a healthy
    WebServer with a webserver.properties set up, adjust your URLs in
    <code class="filename">sqltool.rc</code>, and set TARGET_CLASS in the config
    file.</p>
<p>By following the commented examples in the config file, you can
    start up any number of Server and/or WebServer listener instances with or
    without TLS encryption, and each listener instance can serve any number of
    HyperSQL catalogs (independent data sets), all with optimal efficiency
    from a single JVM process. There are instructions in the init script
    itself about how to run multiple, independently-configured JVM processes.
    Most UNIX installations, however, will run a single JVM with a single
    Listener instance which serves multiple catalogs, for easier management
    and more efficient resource usage.</p>
<p>After you have the init script set up, root can use it anytime to
    start or stop HSQLDB. (I.e., not just at system bootup or
    shutdown).</p>

<h3 class="title">
<a name="uxc_init_script_portability"></a>Portability of <code class="filename">hsqldb</code> init script</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The primary design criterion of the init script is portability.
      It does not print pretty color startup/shutdown messages as is common in
      late-model Linuxes and HPUX; and it does not keep subsystem state files
      or use the startup/shutdown functions supplied by many UNIXes, because
      these features are all non-portable.</p>
<p>Offsetting these limitations, this one script does it's
      intended job great on the UNIX varieties I have tested, and can easily
      be modified to accommodate other UNIXes. While you don't have tight
      integration with OS-specific daemon administration guis, etc., you do
      have a well tested and well behaved script that gives good, utilitarian
      feedback.</p>

<p>The strategy taken here is to get the init script to run your
      single Server or WebServer first (as specified by TARGET_CLASS). After
      that's working, you can customize the JVM that is run by running
      additional Listener instances in it, running your own application in it
      (embedding), or even overriding HSQLDB behavior with your own overriding
      classes.</p>

# you are giving a class name.  MainInvoker will invoke the normal 
# static main(String[]) method of each such class.  
# By default, MainInvoker will just run TARGET_CLASS with no args.
# Example that runs just the TARGET_CLASS with the specified arguments:
#INVOC_ADDL_ARGS='-silent false'   #but use server.properties property instead!
# Example that runs the TARGET_CLASS plus a WebServer:
#INVOC_ADDL_ARGS='"" org.hsqldb.server.WebServer'
# Note the empty string preceding the class name.
# Example that starts TARGET_CLASS with an argument + a WebServer +
# your own application with its args (i.e., the HSQLDB Servers are
# "embedded" in your application).  (Set SERVER_ADDL_CLASSPATH too).:
#INVOC_ADDL_ARGS='-silent false "" org.hsqldb.server.WebServer "" com.acme.Stone --env prod localhost'
#   but use server.properties for -silent option instead!
# Example to run a non-TLS server in same JVM with a TLS server.  In this
# case, TARGET_CLASS is Server which will run both in TLS mode by virtue of 
# setting the tls, keyStore, and keyStorePassword settings in
# server*.properties, as described below; plus an "additional" Server with
# overridden 'tls' and 'port' settings:
#INVOC_ADDL_ARGS="'' org.hsqldb.server.Server --port 9002 --tls false"
# This is an important use case.  If you run more than one Server instance,
# you can specify different parameters for each here, even though only one
# server.properties file is supported.
# Note that you use nested quotes to group arguments and to specify the
# empty-string delimiter.

# The TLS_* settings have been obsoleted.
# To get your server running with TLS, set
# system.javax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/your/private.keystore
# system.javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=secretPassword
# server.ssl=true
# IN server.properties or webserver.properties, and
# MAKE THE FILE OWNER-READ-ONLY!
# See the TLS Encryption section of the HyperSQL User Guide, paying attention
# to the security warning(s).
# If you are running with a private server cert, then you will also need to 
# set "truststore" in the your SqlTool config file (location is set by the
# AUTH_FILE variable in this file, or it must be at the default location for 
# HSQLDB_OWNER).

# Any JVM args for the invocation of the JDBC client used to verify DB
# instances and to shut them down (SqlToolSprayer).
# Server-side System Properties should normally be set with system.*
# settings in the server/webserver.properties file.
# This example specifies the location of a private trust store for TLS 
# encryption.
# For multiple args, put quotes around entire value.
# If you are starting just a TLS_encrypted Listener, you need to uncomment
# this so the init scripts uses TLS to connect.
# If using a private keystore, you also need to set "truststore" settings in
# the sqltool.rc file.
#CLIENT_JVMARGS=-Djavax.net.debug=ssl
# This sample value displays useful debugging information about TLS/SSL.

# Any JVM args for the server.
# For multiple args, put quotes around entire value.
#SERVER_JVMARGS=-Xmx512m
# You can set the "javax.net.debug" property on the server side here, in the
# same exact way as shown for the client side above.

<p>at any time to see

          running.</p>
<p>Re-run the script with each of the possible arguments to
          really test it good. If anything doesn't work right, then see the
          <a class="link" href="unix-chapt.html#uxc_inittrouble" title="Troubleshooting the Init Script">Troubleshooting the Init
      Script</a> section.</p>
</li>
<li class="step" title="Step 5">
<p>Tell your OS to run the init script upon system startup and
          shutdown. If you are using a UNIX variant that has
          <code class="filename">/etc/rc.conf</code> or
          <code class="filename">/etc/rc.conf.local</code> (like BSD variants and
          Gentoo), you must set "hsqldb_enable" to "YES" in either of those
          files. (Just run <code class="literal">cd /etc; ls rc.conf
          rc.conf.local</code> to see if you have one of these files). For
          good UNIXes that use System V style init, you must set up hard links
          or soft links either manually or with management tools (such as
          <code class="literal">chkconfig</code> or <code class="literal">insserv</code>) or Gui's
          (like run level editors).</p>
<p>This paragraph is for Mac OS X users only. If you followed the
          instructions above, your init script should reside at
          <code class="filename">/Library/StartupItems/hsqldb/hsqldb</code>. Now copy
          the file <code class="filename">StartupParameters.plist</code> from the
          directory <code class="filename">src/org.hsqldb/sample</code> of your HSQLDB
          distribution to the same directory as the init script. As long as
          these two files reside in
          <code class="filename">/Library/StartupItems/hsqldb</code>, your init script
          is active (for portability reasons, it doesn't check for a setting
          in <code class="filename">/etc/hostconfig</code>). You can run it as a
          <span class="emphasis"><em>Startup Item</em></span> by running </p>
<pre class="screen"> SystemStarter {start|stop|restart} Hsqldb</pre>
<p>
          Hsqldb is the service name. See the man page for
          <code class="classname">SystemStarter</code>. To disable the init script,
          wipe out the <code class="filename">/Library/StartupItems/hsqldb</code>
          directory. Hard to believe, but the Mac people tell me that during
          system shutdown the Startup Items don't run at all. Therefore, if
          you don't want your data corrupted, make sure to run "SystemStarter
          stop Hsqldb" before shutting down your Mac.</p>

<p>Follow the examples in the config file to add additional
      classes to the server JVM's classpath and to execute additional classes
      in your JVM. (See the <code class="varname">SERVER_ADDL_CLASSPATH</code> and
      <code class="varname">INVOC_ADDL_ARGS</code> items).</p>

<p>Definitely look at the init script log file, which is at an
      OS-sependent location, but is usually at
      <code class="filename">/var/log/hsqldb.log</code>.</p>
<p>Do a <code class="literal">ps</code> to look for processes containing the
      string <code class="literal">hsqldb</code>, and try to connect to the database
      from any client. If the init script starts up your database
      successfully, but incorrectly reports that it has not, then your problem
      is with specification of urlid(s) or SqlTool setup. If your database
      really did not start, then skip to the next paragraph. Verify that your
      config file assigns a urlid for each catalog defined in
      <code class="filename">server.properties</code> or
      <code class="filename">webserver.properties</code>, then verify that you can run
      <code class="classname">SqlTool</code> as root to connect to the catalogs with
      these urlids. (For the latter test, use the <code class="literal">--rcfile</code>
      switch if you are setting <code class="varname">AUTH_FILE</code> in the init
      script config file).</p>
<p>If your database really is not starting, then verify that you
      can <code class="literal">su</code> to the database owner account and start the
      database. The command <code class="literal">su USERNAME -c ...</code> won't work
      on most UNIXes unless the target user has a real login shell. Therefore,
      if you try to tighten up security by disabling this user's login shell,
      you will break the init script. If these possibilities don't pan out,
      then debug the init script or seek help, as described below.</p>
<p>To debug the init script, run it in verbose mode to see exactly
      what is happening (and perhaps manually run the steps that are suspect).
      To run an init script (in fact, any sh shell script) in verbose mode,
      use <code class="literal">sh</code> with the <code class="literal">-x</code> or
      <code class="literal">-v</code> switch, like </p>
<pre class="screen"> sh -x path/to/hsqldb start</pre>
<p>
      See the man page for <code class="literal">sh</code> if you don't know the
      difference between <code class="literal">-v</code> and
      <code class="literal">-x</code>.</p>
<p>If you want troubleshooting help, use the HSQLDB lists/forums.
      Make sure to include the revision number from your
      <code class="filename">hsqldb</code> init script (it's towards the top in the
      line that starts like "# $Id:"), and the output of a run of </p>
<pre class="screen"> sh -x path/to/hsqldb start &gt; /tmp/hstart.log 2&gt;&amp;1</pre>

<p>This section is for users who are using our UNIX init script, and
    who are upgrading their HyperSQL installation.</p>
<p>Most users will not have customized the init script itself, and
    your customizations will all be encapsulated in the init script
    configuration file. These users should just overwrite their init script
    with a new one from the HyperSQL installation, and manually merge config
    file settings. First, just copy the file
    <code class="filename">/sample/hsqldb.init</code> over top of of your init script
    (wherever it runs from). Then update your old config file according to the
    instructions in the new config file template at
    <code class="filename">sample/hsqldb.cfg</code>. You will have to change very few
    settings. If you are upgrading from a pre-2.0 installation to a post-2.0
    installation, you will need to (1) add the setting
    <code class="varname">URLIDS</code>, as described above and in the inline comments,
    and (2) replace variable <code class="varname">HSQLDB_JAR_PATH</code> with
    <code class="varname">SQLTOOL_JAR_PATH</code> which (if you haven't guessed) should
    be set to the path to your <code class="filename">sqltool.jar</code>
    file.</p>
<p>Users who customized their init script will need to merge their
    customizations into the new init script.</p>
