<p>HyperSQL has many modes of operation and features that allow it to
    be used in very different scenarios. Levels of memory usage, speed and
    accessibility by different applications are influenced by how HyperSQL is
    deployed.</p>

</div>
<p>The decision to run HyperSQL as a separate server process or as an
      <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> database should be based on the
      following:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>When HyperSQL is run as a server on a separate machine, it
            is isolated from hardware failures and crashes on the hosts
            running the application.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>When HyperSQL is run as a server on the same machine, it is
            isolated from application crashes and memory leaks.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Server connections are slower than
            <em class="glossterm">in-process</em> connections due to the overhead
            of streaming the data for each JDBC call.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>You can reduce client/server traffic using SQL Stored
            procedures to reduce the number of JDBC execute calls.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>During development, it is better to use a Server with
            server.silent=false, which displays the statements sent to the

<div class="section" title="Database Types">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="N143CE"></a>Database Types</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are three types of database, <code class="literal">mem:</code>,
      <code class="literal">file:</code> and <code class="literal">res:</code>. The mem: type is
      stored all in memory and not persisted to file. The
      <code class="literal">file:</code> type is persisted to file. The
      <code class="literal">res:</code> type is also based on files, but the files are
      loaded from the classpath, similar to resource and class files. Changes
      to the data in <code class="literal">file:</code> databases are persisted, unless
      the database is <code class="literal">readonly</code>, or
      <code class="literal">files_readonly</code> (using optional property settings).
      Changes to <code class="literal">res:</code> databases are not persisted.</p>
<div class="section" title="Readonly Databases">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h4 class="title">
<a name="mtc_readonly_database"></a>Readonly Databases</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A <em class="glossterm">file:</em> catalog can be made readonly
        permanently, or it can be opened as readonly. To make the database
        readonly, the property, value pair, <code class="literal">readonly=true</code>
        can be added to the <code class="filename">.properties</code> file of the
        database. The SHUTDOWN command must be used to close the database
        before making this change.</p>
<p>It is also possible to open a normal database as readonly. For
        this, the property can be included in the URL of the first connection
        to the database.</p>
<p>With readonly databases, it is still possible to insert and
        delete rows in TEMP tables.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" title="RES and Files Readonly Databases">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h4 class="title">
<a name="N14401"></a>RES and Files Readonly Databases</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>There is another option which allows MEMORY tables to be
        writeable, but without persisting the changes at SHUTDOWN. This option
        is activated with the property, value pair,
        <code class="literal">files_readonly=true</code>, which can be added to the
        <code class="filename">.properties</code> file of the database, or included in
        the URL of the first connection to the database.</p>
<p>A <em class="glossterm">res:</em> catalog, is a set of database
        files on the classpath (inside a jar or alongside class files). The
        database is opened with a URL in the form of
        <code class="literal">jdbc:hsqldb:res:&lt;database path&gt;</code>. These
        databases are always <code class="literal">files_readonly</code> and have the
        same restrictions as <code class="literal">files_readonly</code>
        <em class="glossterm">file:</em> catalogs.</p>
<p>CACHED tables and LOBS in these catalogs are readonly. It is not
        possible to create new LOBs in these catalogs, but you can use
        existing LOBs in new rows.</p>
<p>These options are useful for running application tests which
        operate on a predefined dataset.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" title="Tables">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_table_types"></a>Tables</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>TEXT tables are designed for special applications where the data
      has to be in an interchangeable format, such as CSV (comma separated
      values). TEXT tables should not be used for routine storage of data that
      changes a lot.</p>
<p>MEMORY tables and CACHED tables are generally used for data
      storage. The difference between the two is as follows:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>The data for all MEMORY tables is read from the *.script
            file when the database is started and stored in memory. In
            contrast the data for cached tables is not read into memory until
            the table is accessed. Furthermore, only part of the data for each
            CACHED table is held in memory, allowing tables with more data
            than can be held in memory.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>When the database is shutdown in the normal way, all the
            data for MEMORY tables is written out to the disk. In comparison,
            the data in CACHED tables that has changed is written out during
            operation and at shutdown.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>The size and capacity of the data cache for all the CACHED
            tables is configurable. This makes it possible to allow all the
            data in CACHED tables to be cached in memory. In this case, speed
            of access is good, but slightly slower than MEMORY tables.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>For normal applications it is recommended that MEMORY tables
            are used for small amounts of data, leaving CACHED tables for
            large data sets. For special applications in which speed is
            paramount and a large amount of free memory is available, MEMORY
            tables can be used for large tables as well.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>You can change the type of the table with the <code class="literal">SET
            TABLE &lt;table name&gt; TYPE { CACHED | MEMORY
            }</code>statement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" title="Large Objects">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_large_objects"></a>Large Objects</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>HyperSQL 2.0 supports dedicated storage and access to BLOB and
      CLOB objects. These objects can have huge sizes. BLOB or CLOB is
      specified as the type of a column of the table. Afterwards, rows can be
      inserted into the table using a PreparedStatement for efficient transfer
      of large LOB data to the database. In <em class="glossterm">mem:</em>
      catalogs, CLOB and BLOB data is stored in memory. In
      <em class="glossterm">file:</em> catalogs, this data is stored in a single
      separate file which has the extension *.lobs. The size of this file can
      grow to huge, terabyte figures. By default, a minimum 32 KB is allocated
      to each LOB. You can reduced this if your LOBs are generally
      smaller.</p>
<p>LOB data should be stored in the database using a JDBC
      PreparedStatement object. The streaming methods send the LOB to the
      database in one operation as a binary or character stream. Inside the
      database, the disk space is allocated as needed and the data is saved as
      it is being received. LOB data should be retrieved from the database
      using a JDBC ResultSet method. When a streaming method is used to
      retrieve a LOB, it is retrieved in large chunks in a transparent manner.
      LOB data can also be retrieved as String or byte[], but these methods
      use more memory and may not be practical for large objects.</p>
<p>LOB data is not duplicated in the database when a lob is copied
      from one table to another. The disk space is reused when a LOB is
      deleted and is no longer contained in any table. This happens only at
      the time of a CHECKPOINT.</p>
<p>By using a dedicated LOB store, HyperSQL achieves consistently
      high speeds (usually over 20MB / s) for both storage and retrieval of
      LOBs.</p>
<p>There is an internal LOBS schema in the database to store the
      id's, sizes and addresses of the LOBs (but not the actual LOBS) in a few
      system tables. This schema is stored in the database as MEMORY tables.
      Therefore the amount of JVM memory should be increased when more than
      tens of thousands of LOBs are stored in the database. If your database
      contains more than a few hundreds of thousands of LOBs and memory use
      becomes an issue, you can change one or all LOB schema tables to CACHED
      tables. See statements below:</p>

<p>The files used for storing HyperSQL database data are all in the
      same directory. New files are always created and deleted by the database
      engine. Two simple principles must be observed:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>The Java process running HyperSQL must have full privileges on
          the directory where the files are stored. This include create and
          delete privileges.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>The file system must have enough spare room both for the
          'permanent' and 'temporary' files. The default maximum size of the
          *.log file is 50MB. The *.data file can grow to up to 64GB (more if
          the default has been increased). The .backup file can be up to the
          size of the *.data file. The *.lobs file can grow to several
          terabytes. The temporary files created at the time of a SHUTDOWN can
          be equal in size to the *.script file and the .data file.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>In desktop deployments, virus checker programs may interfere

<p>HyperSQL 2.0 uses the same persistence mechanism as version 1.8, but
    with important enhancements. The code has proven reliable, as the last
    critical issue was fixed 2 years before the release of version 2.0.</p>
<p>There are further enhancements in version 2.2</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>More extensive locking mechanism has been added to code to

<p>The NIO file access implementation has been improved</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Persistence relies on the JVM, the operating system, and the
    computer hardware. A database system like HSQLDB can perform millions of
    read and write operations in an hour. As system hardware and software can
    go wrong, it is impossible to achieve zero failure rate. Therefore regular
    backups are recommended. HyperSQL 2.2 has built-in database backup and
    restore features, discussed elsewhere in this chapter.</p>
<p>A note regarding the NIO file access implementation: This
    implementation applies only to CACHED table data in the
    <code class="literal">.data</code> file. Other files are not accessed via NIO. There
    has been an issue with some JVM implementations of nio not releasing the
    file buffers after they were closed. HyperSQL uses a workaround which is
    recommended for Sun JVM's. This does not apply to other JVM's. In such
    environments, it is therefore recommended to test the CHECKPOINT DEFRAG
    operation and the shutting down and restarting the database inside the
    same Java process extensively with NIO. Use of NIO can be turned off if
    necessary.</p>
<div class="section" title="Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_acid"></a>Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Atomicity means a transaction either fails without changing the
      data, or succeeds. HyperSQL ensures atomicity both during operations and
      in the event of a system crash.</p>
<p>Consistency means all the implicit and explicit integrity
      constraints are always enforced. HyperSQL always enforces the
      constraints and at the same time does not allow unenforceable
      constraints (illegal forms of CHECK constraints) to be created.</p>
<p>Isolation means transactions do not interfere with each other.
      HyperSQL enforces isolation according to strict rules of the database
      isolation model (MVCC or LOCKS).</p>
<p>Durability means a committed transaction is protected in case of a
      system crash. HyperSQL ensures durability according to the setting for
      WRITE DELAY MILLIS. A zero delay setting results in an
      FileDescriptor#sync() call each time a transaction commits. A timed
      delay means the FileDescriptor#sync() call is executed in the given
      intervals and only the last transactions committed in the time interval
      may be lost. The default time interval is 0.5 second. The sync() call is
      also made at all critical points, including when a file is about to be
      closed. Durability of files requires a reliable JVM and disk storage
      system that stores the data safely with a sync() call. In practice, many
      systems are generally reliable in this respect.</p>

<p>A database is opened when the first connection is successfully
      made. It remains open until the <code class="literal">SHUTDOWN</code> command is
      issued. If the connection property shutdown=true is used for the first
      connection to the database, the database is shutdown when the last
      connection is closed. Otherwise the database remains open and will
      accept the next connection attempt.</p>
<p>The <code class="literal">SHUTDOWN</code> command shuts down the database
      properly and allows the database to be reopened quickly. This command
      may take some seconds as it saves all the modified data in the
      .<code class="literal">script</code> and <code class="literal">.data</code> files. Variants
      of <code class="literal">SHUTDOWN</code> such as <code class="literal">SHUTDOWN
      COMPACT</code> and <code class="literal">SHUTDOWN SCRIPT</code> can be used
      from time to time to reduce the overall size of the database files.
      Another variant is <code class="literal">SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATELY</code> which ensures
      all changes to data are stored in the <code class="literal">.log</code> file but
      does not save the changes in .<code class="literal">script</code> and
      <code class="literal">.data</code> files. The shutdown is performed quickly but
      the database will take much longer to reopen.</p>
<p>During the lifetime of the database the checkpoint operation may
      be performed from time to time. The <code class="literal">SET FILES LOG SIZE &lt;
      value &gt;</code> setting and its equivalent URL property determine
      the frequency of automatic checkpoints. An online backup also performs a
      checkpoint when the backup is not a hot backup. A checkpoint can be
      performed by the user at any time using the
      <code class="literal">CHECKPOINT</code> statement. The main purpose of checkpoints
      is to reduce the total size of database files and to allow a quick
      restart in case the database is closed without a proper shutdown. The
      <code class="literal">CHECKPOINT DEFRAG</code> variant compacts the
      <code class="literal">.data</code> file the same way as <code class="literal">SHUTDOWN
      COMPACT</code> does. Obviously this variant takes much longer than a
      normal <code class="literal">CHECKPOINT</code>. A database setting allows a
      <code class="literal">CHECKPOINT DEFRAG</code> to be performed automatically when
      wasted space in the <code class="literal">.data</code> file exceeds the specified
      percentage.</p>
<p>In a multi-user application, automatic or user-initiated
      checkpoints are delayed until all other sessions have committed or
      rolled back. During a checkpoint, other sessions cannot access the
      database tables but can access the <code class="literal">INFORMATION_SCHEMA</code>
      system tables.</p>

<p>The database engine saves the files containing all the data in a
    file catalog when a shutdown takes place. It automatically recovers from
    an abnormal termination and preserves the data when the catalog is opened
    next time. In an ideal operating environment, where there is no OS crash,
    disk failure, bugs in code, etc. there would be no need to backup a
    database. Backing up catalogs is an insurance policy against all sorts of
    misadventure that are not under the control of the database engine.</p>
<p>The data for each catalog consists of up to 5 files in the same
    directory with the endings such as <code class="literal">*.properties</code>,
    <code class="literal">*.script</code>, etc., as detailed in previous
    chapters.</p>
<p>HyperSQL 2 includes commands to backup the database files into a
    single <code class="literal">.tar</code> or <code class="literal">.tar.gz</code> file archive,
    or alternatively as copies of the database files. The backup can be
    performed by a command given in a JDBC session if the target database
    catalog is running, or on the command-line if the target catalog has been
    shutdown.</p>
<p>It is not recommended to backup the database file with an
    external file backup program while the database is running. The resulting
    backup will probably be inconsistent and not useful for restoring the
    database</p>

</div>
<p>To back up a running catalog, obtain a JDBC connection and
      issue a <code class="literal">BACKUP DATABASE</code> command in SQL. In its most
      simple form, the command format below will backup the database as a
      single <code class="literal">.tar.gz</code> file to the given directory. This type
      of backup performs a checkpoint immediately before backing up the
      files.</p>
<pre class="programlisting"> BACKUP DATABASE TO &lt;directory name&gt; BLOCKING [ AS FILES ]</pre>
<p>The <span class="emphasis"><em>directory name</em></span> must end with a slash
      to distinguish it as a directory, and the whole string must be in single
      quotes like so: <code class="literal">'subdir/nesteddir/'</code>.</p>
<p>Normal backup may take a long time with very large databases.
      Hot backup may be used in those situations. This type of backup does not
      perform a checkpoint and allows access to the database while backup is
      in progress.</p>
<pre class="programlisting"> BACKUP DATABASE TO &lt;directory name&gt; NOT BLOCKING [ AS FILES ]</pre>
<p>If you add AS FILES to the statements, the database files are

<p>HyperSQL supports encrypted databases. Encryption services use the
    Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) and uses the ciphers installed with the
    JRE. HyperSQL itself does not contain any cryptography code.</p>
<p>Three elements are involved in specifying the encryption method and
    key. A cipher, together with its configuration is identified by a string
    which includes the name of the cipher and optional parameters. A provider
    is the fully qualified class name of the cipher provider. A key is
    represented as a hexadecimal string.</p>
<div class="section" title="Creating and Accessing an Encrypted Database">
<div class="titlepage">
<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_encrypted_create"></a>Creating and Accessing an Encrypted Database</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>First, a key must be created for the desired cipher and
      configuration. This is done by calling the function CRYPT_KEY(&lt;cipher
      spec&gt;, &lt;provider&gt;). If the default provider (the built-in JVM
      ciphers) is used, then NULL should be specified as the provider. The
      CRYPT_KEY function returns a hexadecimal key. The function call can be
      made in any HyperSQL database, so long as the provider class is on the
      classpath. This key can be used to create a new encrypted database.
      Calls to this function always return different keys, based on a
      generated random values.</p>
<p>As an example, a call to CRYPT_KEY('Blowfish', null) returned the
      string, '604a6105889da65326bf35790a923932'. To create a new database,
      the URL below is used:</p>
<p>
<code class="literal">jdbc:hsqldb:file:&lt;database
      path&gt;;crypt_key=604a6105889da65326bf35790a923932;crypt_type=blowfish</code>
</p>
<p>The third property name is crypt_provider. This is specified only
      when the provider is not the default provider.</p>
<p>HyperSQL works with any symmetric cipher that may be available
      from the JVM.</p>
<p>The files that are encrypted include the .script, .data, .backup
      and .log files. The .lobs file is not encrypted by default. The property
      crypt_lobs=true must be specified to encrypt the .lobs file. When this
      property is used, the blobs and clobs are both compressed and
      encrypted.</p>

<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_encrypted_speed"></a>Speed Considerations</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p>General operations on an encrypted database are performed the same
      as with any database. However, some operations are significantly slower
      than with the equivalent cleartext database. With MEMORY tables, there
      is no difference to the speed of SELECT statements, but data change
      statements are slower. With CACHED tables, the speed of all statements
      is slower.</p>

<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_encrypted_security"></a>Security Considerations</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Security considerations for encrypted databases have been
      discussed at length in HSQLDB discussion groups. Development team
      members have commented that encryption is not a panacea for all security
      needs. The following issues should be taken into account:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
<p>Encrypted files are relatively safe in transport, but
            because databases contain many repeated values and words,
            especially known tokens such as CREATE, INSERT, etc., breaking the
            encryption of a database may be simpler than an unknown
            file.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>Only the files are encrypted, not the memory image. Poking
            into computer memory, while the database is open, will expose the
            contents of the database.</p>
</li>
<li class="listitem">
<p>HyperSQL is open source. Someone who has the key, can
            compile and use a modified version of the program that saves a
            full cleartext dump of an encrypted database</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Therefore encryption is generally effective only when
      the users who have access to the crypt key are trusted.</p>

<p>Statement level monitoring allows you to gather statistics about
      executed statements. HyperSQL is supported by the monitoring tool JAMon
      (Java Application Monitor). JAMon is currently developed as the
      SourceForge project, jamonapi.</p>
<p>JAMon works at the JDBC level. It can monitor and gather
      statistics on different types of executed statements or other JDBC
      calls.</p>
<p>Early versions of JAMon were developed with HSQLDB and had to be
      integrated into HSQLDB at code level. The latest versions can be added
      on as a proxy in a much simpler fashion.</p>

<p>The internally-generated, individual sql log for the database can
      be enabled with the <code class="literal">SET DATABASE EVENT LOG SQL LEVEL</code>
      statement, described in this chapter. As all the executed statements are
      logged, there is an impact on speed. So you should only use this for
      debugging. Two levels of sql logging are supported.</p>

<div>
<div>
<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_internal_event_monitoring"></a>Internal Event Monitoring</h3>

</div>
</div>
<p>HyperSQL can log important internal events of the engine. These
      events occur during the operation of the engine, and are not always
      coupled with the exact type of statement being executed. Normal events
      such as opening and closing of files, or errors such as OutOfMemory
      conditions are examples of logged events.</p>
<p>HyperSQL supports two methods of logging. One method is specific
      to the individual database and is managed internally by HyperSQL. The
      other method is specific to JVM and is managed by a logging
      framework.</p>
<p>The internally-generated, individual log for the database can be
      enabled with the <code class="literal">SET DATABASE EVENT LOG LEVEL</code>
      statement, described in this chapter. This method of logging is very
      useful for desktop application deployment, as it provides an ongoing
      record of database operations.</p>

<p>HyperSQL also supports log4J and JDK logging. The same event
      information that is passed to the internal log, is passed to external
      logging frameworks. These frameworks are typically configured outside
      HyperSQL. The log messages include the string "hsqldb.db." followed by
      the unique id (a 16 character string) of the database that generated the
      message, so they can be identified in a multi-database server
      context.</p>
<p>As the default JDK logging framework has several shortcomings,
      HyperSQL configures this logging framework for better operation. If you
      do not want HyperSQL to configure the JDK logging framework, you should
      include the system level property
      <code class="literal">hsqldb.reconfig_logging=false</code> in your

<div>

<h3 class="title">
<a name="mtc_security_defaults"></a>Security Defaults</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The default setting are generally adequate for most embedded use
      of the database or for servers on the host that are accessed from the
      same machine. For servers accessed within a network, and especially for
      those accessed from outside the network, additional security settings
      must be used.</p>
<p>The default settings for server and web server do not use SSL or
      IP access control lists. These features are enabled programatically, or
      with the properties used to start the server.</p>
<p>The default settings allow a database user with the DBA role or
      with schema creation role to access static functions on the classpath.
      You can disable this feature or limit it to specific classes and
      methods. This can be done programatically or by setting a system
      property when you start a server.</p>
<p>If access to specific static functions is granted, then these
      functions must be considered as part of the database program and checked
      for any security flaws before inclusion in the classpath.</p>
<p>The default settings do not allow a user to access files outside
      the database directory. This access is for TEXT table source files. You
      can override this programatically or with a system property when you
      start a server.</p>
<p>The encryption of database file does not utilise any user-supplied
      information for encryption keys. This level of security is outside the
      realm of users and passwords.</p>
<p>The first user for a new database has the DBA role. This user name
      was always SA in older versions of HSQLDB, but not in the latest
      versions. The name of the first DBA user and its password can be
      specified when the database is created by the first connection to the
      database. These settings are then stored in the database.</p>
<p>The initial user with the DBA role should be used for admin
      purposes only. At least one additional role should be created for normal
      database use in the application and at least one additional user should
      be created and granted this role. The new role should not be given the
      DBA role. It can be given the CREATE_SCHEMA role, which allows it to
      create and access multiple schemas. Alternatively, the user with the DBA
      role can create the schemas and their objects and then grant specific
      privileges on the objects to the non-DBA role.</p>

<p>Authentication is the mechanism that determines if a user can
      access the database at all. Once authentication is performed, the
      authorization mechanism is used to determine which database objects the
      particular user can access. The default authentication mechanism is
      password authentication. Each user is created with a password, which is
      stored in the database and checked each time a new database connection
      is created.</p>
<a name="N14612" class="indexterm"></a>
<p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Password Complexity
      Check</strong></span>
</p>
<p>HyperSQL allows you to define a function that checks the quality
      of the passwords defined in the database. The passwords are stored in
      the database. Each time a user connects, the user's name and password
      are checked against the stored list of users and passwords. The

</p>
<p>You can use an external authentication mechanism instead of the
      internal authentication mechanism. HyperSQL allows you to define a
      function that checks the combination of database unique name, user name,
      and password for each connection attempt. The function can use external
      resources to authenticate the user. For example, a directory server may
      be used. The password may be ignored if the external resource can verify
      the user's credential without it.</p>
<p>You can override external authentication for a user with the ALTER
      USER statement. See the <a class="link" href="accesscontrol-chapt.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Access Control">Access Control</a> chapter</p>

<p>HyperSQL is used more than any other database engine for application
    testing and development targeted at other databases. Over the years, this
    usage resulted in developers finding and reporting many obscure bugs in
    HyperSQL, which have all been fixed in the latest version. Also, HyperSQL
    2 has been written to the SQL Standard and avoids the traps caused by
    superficial imitation of existing RDBMS.</p>
<p>HyperSQL has many property settings that relax conformance to the
    Standard in order to allow compatibility with other RDBMS, without
    breaking the core integrity of the database. These properties are modified
    with SET DATABASE SQL statements described in the SQL Conformance Settings
    section of this chapter</p>
<p>The SQL Standard has existed since 1989 and has been expanded over
    the years in several revisions. Also, the X-Open specification has defined
    a number of SQL functions which are implemented by most RDBMS.</p>
<p>Each RDBMS supports additional functions that are not covered by the
    standard. Some RDBMS use non-standard syntax for some operations.
    Fortunately, most popular RDBMS products have introduced better
    compatibility with the Standard in their recent versions, but there are
    still some portability issues. HyperSQL overcomes the potability issues
    using these strategies</p>

<p>MySQL had many incompatibilities with the Standard. The latest

      specified directory. The archive is in <code class="literal">.tar.gz</code> or
      <code class="literal">.tar</code> format depending on whether it is compressed or
      not.</p>
<p>If the <code class="literal">&lt;file path&gt;</code> does not end with a
      forward slash, it specifies a user-defined file name for the backup
      archive. The file extension must be either <code class="literal">.tar.gz</code> or
      <code class="literal">.tar</code> and this must match the compression
      option.</p>
<p>The default set of options is COMPRESSED BLOCKING.</p>
<p>If SCRIPT is specified, the backup will contain a
      <code class="literal">*.script</code> file, which contain all the data and
      settings of the database. This type of backup is suitable for smaller
      databases. With larger databases, this takes a long time. When the
      SCRIPT option is no used, the backup set will consist of the current
      snapshot of all database files.</p>
<p>If NOT COMPRESSED is specified, the backup is a tar file,
      without compression. Otherwise, it is in gzip format.</p>
<p>The qualifier, BLOCKING, means all database operations are
      suspended during backup. During backup, a CHECKPOINT command is silently
      executed. This mode is always used when SCRIPT is specified.</p>
<p>Hot backup is performed if NOT BLOCKING is specified. In this
      mode, the database can be used during backup. This mode should only be
      used with very large databases. A hot backup set is less compact and
      takes longer to restore and use than a normal backup set produced with
      the BLOCKING option. You can perform a CHECKPOINT just before a hot
      backup in order to reduce the size of the backup set.</p>
<p>If AS FILES is specified, the database files are copied to a
      directory specified by &lt;file path&gt; without any compression. The
      file path must be a directory. If the directory does not exist, it is
      created. The file path may be absolute or relative. If it is relative,
      it is interpreted as relative to the location of database files. When AS
      FILES is specified, SCRIPT or COMPRESSED options are not available. The
      backup can be performed as BLOCKING or NOT BLOCKING.</p>
<p>The HyperSQL jar also contains a program that creates an
      archive of an offline database. It also contains a program to expand an
      archive into database files. These programs are documented in this
      chapter under Backing up Database Catalogs.</p>

<p>Each database can have its own default collation. Sets the

</p>
<p>Set the WRITE DELAY property of the database. The WRITE DELAY
      controls the frequency of file sync for the log file. When WRITE_DELAY
      is set to FALSE or 0, the sync takes place immediately at each COMMIT.
      WRITE DELAY TRUE performs the sync once every 0.5 seconds (which is the
      default). A numeric value can be specified instead.</p>
<p>The purpose of this command is to control the amount of data loss
      in case of a total system crash. A delay of 1 second means at most the
      data written to disk during the last second before the crash is lost.
      All data written prior to this has been synced and should be
      recoverable.</p>
<p>A write delay of 0 impacts performance in high load situations, as
      the engine has to wait for the file system to catch up.</p>
<p>To avoid this, you can set write delay down to 10
      milliseconds.</p>
<p>Each time the SET FILES WRITE DELAY statement is executed with any
      value, a sync is immediately performed.</p>
<p>Only a user with the DBA role can execute this statement.</p>

<p>
<code class="literal">&lt;set files scale statement&gt; ::= SET FILES SCALE

</p>
<p>Changes the scale factor for the .data file. The default scale
      is 8 and allows 16GB of data storage capacity. The scale can be
      increased in order to increase the maximum data storage capacity. The
      scale values 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 are allowed. Scale value
      1024 allows a maximum capacity of 2 TB.</p>
<p>This command can be used only when there is no data in CACHED
      tables. This is equivalent to the connection property
      <code class="literal">hsqldb.cache_file_scale</code>.</p>
<p>The scale factor indicates the size of the unit of storage of
      data in bytes. For example, with a scale factor of 128, a row containing
      a small amount of data will use 128 bytes. Larger rows may use multiple
      units of 128 bytes.</p>

<p>
<code class="literal">&lt;set files lob scale statement&gt; ::= SET FILES
      LOB SCALE &lt;scale value&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>Changes the scale factor for the .lobs file. The scale is
      interpreted in kilobytes. The default scale is 32 and allows 64TB of lob
      data storage capacity. The scale can be reduced in order to improve
      storage efficiency. If the lobs are a lot smaller than 32 kilobytes,
      reducing the scale will reduce wasted space. The scale values 1, 2, 4,
      8, 16, 32 are allowed. For example if the average size of lobs is 4
      kilobytes, the default scale of 32 will result in 28KB wasted space for
      each lob. Reducing the lob scale to 2 will result in average 1KB wasted
      space for each lob.</p>
<p>This command can be used only when there is no lob in the

<p>It is possible to replace the default password authentication

<p>The routine body is an external Java function reference. This
      function has three String parameters. The first parameter is the unique
      name of the database, the second parameter the user name, and the third
      parameter the password.</p>
<p>External authentication can be used in two different patterns.
      In the first pattern, user names must be stored in the database. In the
      second pattern, user names shouldn't be stored in the database and any
      names that are stored in the database are ignored.</p>
<p>In both patterns, the username and password are checked by the
      authentication function. If the function throws a runtime exception then
      authentication fails.</p>
<p>In the first pattern, the function always returns null if
      authentication is successful.</p>
<p>In the second pattern, the function returns a list of role
      names that have been granted to the user. These roles must match the
      ROLE objects that have been defined in the database.</p>
<p>The Java function should return an instance of
      org.hsqldb.jdbc.JDBCArrayBasic constructed with a String[] argument that
      contains the role names.</p>
