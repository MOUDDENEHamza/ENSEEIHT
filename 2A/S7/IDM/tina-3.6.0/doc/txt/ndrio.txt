NAME
       ndrio  - conversion tool for Petri nets and Time Petri nets

       Part of Tina Toolbox for analysis of Petri nets and Time Petri nets.


SYNOPSIS
       ndrio [-help]
             [-NET | -NDR | -PNML | -TPN]
             [-net | -ndr | -pnml | -tpn | -pnt | -romeo | -lola]
             [-graphplace  |  -dot  |  -neato | -circo | -textify] [-ren] [-d]
       [-rev]
             [infile] [outfile] [errorfile]


DESCRIPTION
       ndrio converts Petri nets and Time Petri nets between several,  graphic
       or textual, formats. ndrio handles delay intervals asociated with tran-
       sitions, and generalized inhibitor and read (test) arcs.   The  formats
       manipulated are the following:

       name      file ext  description
       ------------------------------------------------------
       net       .net      tina textual format
       ndr       .ndr      tina graphic format (produced by nd)
       tpn       .tpn      tina textual scripts format
       pnml      .pnml          Petri Net Markup Language format
                           (with or without graphics)
       pnt       .pnt      INA format
                           (If the net is timed, the intervals
                            are saved into a companion .tim file)
       romeo          .romeo     romeo format (without graphics)
       lola      .lola          LoLA format


OPTIONS
       -help Recalls options.


       Input format flags:


       -NET | -NDR | -PNML | -TPN
              Specifies  the  format  of the input net. This flag is necessary
              when the input net is read on standard input,  or  read  from  a
              file that does not bear the expected extension. Default is -NET.


       Output format flags:


       -net | -ndr | -pnml | -tpn | -pnt
              Specifies  the   format of the output  net. This flag  is neces-
              sary when the output net  is written on standard output, or into
              a file that does not bear the expected extension.

              Export  to  romeo  and lola is preliminary. The graphic informa-
              tion, if any, is currently not exported to romeo. Also, the user
              should  make  sure  the  place  and transition names used in the
              input file are legal romeo or lola names; ndrio does not attempt
              to convert them.


       Drawing options:


       -graphplace | -dot | -neato | -circo

              Specify  a placement filter for nodes. Necessary when converting
              from a graphics-free format  into .ndr.   Optional when convert-
              ing  into .pnml (graphics information is only  generated if some
              filter is specified).  When  converting  from  a   graphic  for-
              mat,   the   original  placement information is always retained,
              whatever the tool specified.


       Textifying option:


       -textify

              Removes any graphics information from the input file when graph-
              ics is optional in the output format.



       Other flags:


       -ren | -r

              Renames places and transitions with integers prefixed by "p" and
              "t", respectively.  Old names become labels.


       -d

              Drops all labels of places and transitions.


       -rev

              Reverses the direction of normal edges (inhibitor,  read,  stop-
              watch, stopwatch-inhibitor and priority edges are unchanged).


       Input source:


       infile Where  the   net  is   read. The  input format is  determined by
              the file type, according to the table above. If absent or speci-
              fied  by "-", the net is  read on standard  input in the  format
              specified by  the input flag. If   both  an   infile  and   some
              input flag  are present,  then the format defined  by the  input
              flag supersedes  that determined  by the infile extension.


       Output destination:


       outfile
              Where the net is written. The output format is determined by the
              file  type, according  to the  table above. If  absent or speci-
              fied  by "-", then the net is written on standard output in  the
              format  specified  by  the  output flag. If both an  outfile and
              some output flag are present, then the format  defined  by   the
              output flag supersedes that determined by the outfile extension.


       Errors destination:


       errorfile
              Where error messages are written. By default, errors are printed
              on standard error.
